# YousufK_CIS7Project
This project aims to match participants in the UCR Medical Center Volunteers program with patients based on language fluency and medical specialization through arrays, random selection, switch statements, finite sets, and indexing. This project was solely by Yousuf Khan as the approach was to apply concepts of discrete structures in programming.
