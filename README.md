# YousufK_CIS7Project
This project aims to match participants with patients based on language fluency and medical specialization through arrays, random selection, switch statements, finite sets, and indexing. The programming approach of this project was to apply concepts of discrete structures in programming.
Once you start the program, you will be greeted and asked to select your fluent language. Then, the program will ask for your medical field that you specialize in. Once you enter your choice, the program will randomly assign you a country that corresponds with your chosen language. The probability of your random assignment is then printed by the program.
